# A Collection of Threat Research, Threat Hunting, and Threat Detection Resources

# Frameworks

[MITRE ATTACK Framework](https://attack.mitre.org/)
<br>"MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community."

# Exploit Databases

[ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
<br>"The Exploit Database is a CVE compliant archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software, developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need actionable data right away."

# Vulnerability Databases

[MITRE CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/)
<br>"The mission of the CVE® Program is to identify, define, and catalog publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities."

[CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)
<br>"CISA works with partners to defend against today’s threats and collaborates to build a more secure and resilient infrastructure for the future."


# Security Research Articles, Blogs, etc. 

[Red Canary Blog](https://redcanary.com/blog/)
<br>"Security teams need an ally to help defend against adversaries. Check out our blog for breaking research and insights into threat detection, intelligence, and incident response."

# Threat Detections

[MITRE CAR](https://car.mitre.org/coverage/)
<br>"The MITRE Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR) is a knowledge base of analytics developed by MITRE based on the MITRE ATT&CK adversary model. CAR defines a data model that is leveraged in its pseudocode representations, but also includes implementations directly targeted at specific tools (e.g., Splunk, EQL) in its analytics. With respect to coverage, CAR is focused on providing a set of validated and well-explained analytics, in particular with regards to their operating theory and rationale."

[SigmaHQ](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma)
<br>"Sigma is a generic and open signature format that allows you to describe relevant log events in a straightforward manner. The rule format is very flexible, easy to write and applicable to any type of log file. The main purpose of this project is to provide a structured form in which researchers or analysts can describe their once developed detection methods and make them shareable with others."

[MITRE D3fend](https://d3fend.mitre.org/)
<br>"D3FEND, a framework in which we encode a countermeasure knowledge base, but more specifically, a knowledge graph. The graph contains semantically rigorous types and relations that define both the key concepts in the cybersecurity countermeasure domain and the relations necessary to link those concepts to each other. We ground each of the concepts and relations to particular references in the cybersecurity literature."

[Open Source Security Events Metadata (OSSEM)](https://github.com/OTRF/OSSEM)
<br>"A community-led project focused primarily on the documentation, standardization and modeling of security event logs."
